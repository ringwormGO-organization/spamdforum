TODO:
o Code quality improvement.
o Make things more modular, store code in multiple files
o ini file for forum configuration (config.ini for forum configuration,
  topic.ini to define ``topics''
o CSRF token to lock users in our form
o basic json editor to edit language files (or just redirect users to use json editors)
o user authentication on /account/admin
o pw.php: If you have an idea about reusing the "update powerlevel"
   checks for adding powered user, please contribute
o rewrite html, especially header.html

Threads (article, ...) = posts (comments) = msg. Stored in the same table.
Inspired by email and IM. A "post" is a msg with the relate_id of another
msg (called a ``comment'')
- How a thread should be identified?
   o relate_id=0
Should we have markdown support? maybe no, it suck. Asterisks, underscores
broke the whole text. Also, not on spamdforum.
